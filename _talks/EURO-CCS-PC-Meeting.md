The Confidential Consortium Framework (CCF) is an open-source framework for building permissioned confidential applications. CCF uses replicated hardware-protected trusted execution environments to ensure confidentiality and integrity whilst providing high throughput and low latency. CCF exposes a transactional programming model atop a key-value store, and supports transparent programmable governance.
