FaRM is an in-memory transactional object store for random-access latency-sensitive workloads, such as graphs and key-value stores. It provides high throughput and low microsecond latency by using remote direct memory access (RDMA) and novel transactional protocols. In addition to presenting FaRM, we have built A1, a graph store built on top of FaRM, and which is being adopted as the next generation graph platform targeting several scenarios in Bing, Office, and Cortana. -- [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/video/farm/)
