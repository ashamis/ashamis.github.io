FaRM is an in-memory transactional object store for random-access latency-sensitive workloads, such as graphs and key-value stores. It provides high throughput and low microsecond latency by using remote direct memory access (RDMA) and novel transactional protocols. In this talk I present FaRM, discuss it's history, and the the direction of the project. Finally, I show how FaRM is being used by Microsoft as a production service.
