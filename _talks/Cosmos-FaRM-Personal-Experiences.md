During my time at Microsoft, I have worked on several different distributed systems that the company uses internally. In this talk, I will describe two of them and also discuss the trade-offs and design choices that were made to build and run these systems. I will firstly talk about Microsoft Cosmos which is Microsoft’s internal big data framework that runs dryad-like jobs which are programmed using the SCOPE language. Then, I will describe FaRM which is a main-memory distributed transactional store that exploits new hardware trends such as RDMA and non-volatile memory to achieve performance that is several orders of magnitude faster than systems that offer similar capability but run using TCP. -- [LSDS - Seminar](https://lsds.doc.ic.ac.uk/content/personal-experiences-building-microsoft%E2%80%99s-cosmos-and-farm)
